  <!-- TUNE THESE PARAMETERS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT ! -->

  <ConstantsSection label="tuneParameters.xml" eval="true">

    <!-- TELESCOPE ARMS AND PLANES: -->
    <!-- ARM -->
    <Constant name="InterArmDeltaZ" value="496.0*mm"/>  <!-- Total distance in Z between the centres of the 2 arms --> <!-- Was 350 mm -->

    <!-- PLANE -->
    <Constant name="InterPlaneDeltaZ" value="50.0*mm"/> <!-- Total distance in Z between the centres of 2 consecutive planes -->
    <Constant name="PlaneTiltAngle" value="30.0*deg"/>  <!-- Rotation around CMS_X. Angle is counted in the counter-trigonometric sense. Angle = 0 on (XY) plane. -->
    <Constant name="PlaneSkewAngle" value="20.0*deg"/>  <!-- Rotation around CMS_Y. Angle is counted in the trigonometric sense. Angle = 0 on (XY) plane. -->
    <!-- NB: "InterPlaneDeltaZ" and "PlaneSkewAngle" must be in [0° 90°]. -->
    <!-- If one want to invert the trigonometric sense they are counted in (should not at all be needed!), -->
    <!-- simply uncomment 2 lines in DDTelescopePlanesAlgo as precisely described in plugins/DDTelescopePlanesAlgo.cc -->

    <!-- PHASE 1 MODULE -->                             
    <Constant name="MovePhase1ModuleInPlaneAlongModuleWidth" value="[telescope:Phase1BPIXModuleWidth] - 8.3*mm"/>    
    <!-- Total distance between the centres of the two Phase 1 modules, along module width (module local X). -->
    <!-- Calculated 8.3 mm overlap as follows: 
    Measured 10.8 mm overlap, counting the full base plates in width (27 mm total width module instead of 24.5 mm).
    Hence the overlap in between 24.5 mm wide module (which we have in the model) is 10.8 - 2.5 = 8.3 mm.
    -->

    <Constant name="MovePhase1ModuleInPlaneAlongModuleThickness" value="1.585*mm"/>    
    <!-- Total distance between the centres of the two Phase 1 modules, along module thickness (module local Y). -->
    <!-- Calculated as follows: 
    Module thickness = 1.28 mm, hence module center is at 0.64 mm from module most external surface.  
    Sensor has an offset of 0.1225 mm inwards (towards telescope plane).
    Hence sensor center is at 0.64 - 0.1225 = 0.5175 mm from module most external surface.
    There is a 0.55 mm gap between the 2 modules most external surfaces.
    Hence the total distance between sensor centers is 2 * 0.5175 + 0.55 = 1.585 mm.

    <!-- DUT: -->
    <!-- DUT translation -->
    <Constant name="DUTTransX" value="0.0*mm"/>         <!-- Total DUT Holder translation along X axis -->

    <Constant name="DUTTransZ" value="0.0*mm"/>         <!-- Total DUT Holder translation along Z axis --> 
    <!-- TO DO!! Tune this as desire. Please not that 0. might cause issue, -->
    <!-- as was not expected to have tilted rings at 0. at the first place (minor correction was needed in CMSSW code). -->

    <!-- DUT rotation -->
    <Constant name="DUTSkewAngle" value="10.0*deg"/>    <!-- Angle around Y, counted from (XY) plane. -->
    <!-- Angle is in [0 20] deg. -->
    <!-- No negative value!! -->
    <!-- If angle >= 0, please use DUTSkewPlus in telescope.xml -->
    <!-- If angle < 0, please use DUTSkewMinus in telescope.xml -->
